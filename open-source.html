        Log4Shell
    </h3>
    <p class="main-text">
        In late 2021, the Log4J zero-day vulnerability, Log4Shell was revealed. Effecting countless programs,
        Log4Shell
        allowed hackers to execute malicious code remotely. The disastrous effects of Log4Shell reveals the
        disastrous
        effects of issues in dependencies.

        Why support matters
    </h3>
    <p class="main-text">
        According to Eric Raymond's essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Linus&#39;s law states: &ldquo;
        given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. &rdquo;
        More support means more bugs such as Log4Shell can be found and patched quicker or detected before entering a
        release. This is also important because of how much code is outdated and can contain vulnrabilities.

        Google&#39;s Open Source Maintenance Crew
    </h3>
    <p class="main-text">
        Due to Log4Shell and other similar vulnerabilities along with a push from the White House to improve
        software
        security, Google recently created its Open Source Maintenance Crew which attempts to protect the security of
        upstream projects and critical open source dependencies.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-3xl text-slate-800 mt-4 font-semibold">
        This is not enough
    </h4>
    <p class="main-text">
        Despite gaining more support from big corporations, smaller organizations must also do their part to help
        fix
        issues
        in the open source projects they utilize. Given open source codeâ€™s massive economic benefits and usage, more
        returned support is expected.

                Promoting GPL/LGPL
            </h3>
            <p class="main-text text-white mx-4 my-4">
                Due to the popularly used MIT and Apache licenses, companies which use an open source product are not
                required
                to
                give back contributions to the code. If more projects used GPL or LGPL this problem would naturally fix
                itself.
                This
                is not feasible however, as many projects do not want to or can not change to a copyleft license.

            <p class="main-text text-white mx-4 my-4">
                Although the government has acted to aid this issue, these are not enough and too slow. The government
                ought
                to
                instead provide incentives for open source developers and companies which contribute back to open source
                projects.

        AP Seminar Reflection
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
        For me, AP Seminar was an amazing opportunity to learn how to find and organize many different academic
        papers.
        Where other classes just give sources with an obvious connection, AP Seminar presented the unique challenge
        of
        having access to the hundreds of thousands of academic sources available. Learning how to find as much
        knowledge
        in a specific domain and how to sort it into a memorable format was something no other class taught and
        extremely useful when I conduct my own personal research.
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">
        With my research on the benefits of open source, I plan on encouraging others to utilize open source
        software
        and I hope to be able to contribute myself to open source projects I use. However, in order to do this, I
        need
        to learn far more about operating systems and low level programming.
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">
        Outside of AP Seminar, I try my best to learn about AI and operating systems. Using my experience of reading
        academic papers from AP Seminar, I try to read and stay up to date with the latest developments in
        artificial
        intelligence. At the moment, I am researching the methods industry leaders such as DeepMind use
        reinforcement
        learning. Furthermore, as a Linux user, I hope to one day be able to contribute myself to the kernel which I
        use.
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">
        After high school I plan on majoring in computer science. While I have not decided which part of computer
        science I want to explore, I am highly interested in computer vision and artificial intelligence.
